# Tutorial: EnvKeyVault

This project configures a **web application** built with the *Next.js framework*, enabling modern features like the App Directory.
It uses *Tailwind CSS* for styling, defining a custom theme and processing styles via *PostCSS* for browser compatibility.
A *Jest testing environment* is also set up using TypeScript for ensuring code quality.
